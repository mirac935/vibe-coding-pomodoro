# Vibe Coding Experience Report

## Tool Selection Rationale
For this project, I selected Replit Agent as the vibe coding tool because it provides an integrated, browser-based development environment. The ability to generate, run, and debug code without switching between multiple tools made it especially appealing for a small but functional web application like a Pomodoro Timer.

## Development Process
The development process began by prompting the AI agent to generate a basic Pomodoro Timer structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After the initial setup, I iteratively refined the application by adding features such as start, pause, and reset controls. Clear and specific prompts, such as requesting countdown logic or improving user interaction, were the most effective. It took several iterations to reach a stable and usable version of the application.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges was managing the timer state correctly, especially preventing multiple timers from running simultaneously. While the AI agent provided helpful suggestions, some logic issues required manual adjustment and testing. Additionally, minor UI improvements were made by manually editing the CSS to enhance readability and layout consistency.

## Reflection
The most surprising aspect of vibe coding was how conversational the development process became. Instead of focusing only on syntax, I was able to describe desired behaviors and let the AI assist with implementation. This approach significantly improved development speed during prototyping. I would consider using vibe coding tools in future projects, particularly for learning and rapid development. Overall, this technology has strong potential to reshape software development by emphasizing intent-driven programming.
